            <p class="intro">I went to New York City in October of 2016 to visit some college friends. Here's a journal!</p>

                <h3>I like to ride my bicycle</h3>
                <p class="description">We spent a lot of time riding bikes. A lot. A 60 mile ride one day and an 80 mile ride another. We toured Manhattan, crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, went to Coney Island and even went a little bit upstate! I passed on the third ride. ;)</p>

                <h3>It's not that I'm afraid to die, I just don't want to be there when it happens</h3>
                <p class="description">We stopped at Coney Island for some calories mid-ride. We noticed a small film crew setting up equipment. The bustle grew while we inhaled deep fried fish and a beer or two. As we were getting ready to leave, I asked a production assistant about the film was and he said it was an untitled Woody Allen project starring Justin Timberlake and Kate Winslett. Woody was a little bit behind him and I was able to grab a picture! Look closely...</p>

                <h3>I cannot not get <a href="http://53rdand6th.com/">Halal Guys</a></h3>
                <p class="description">And of course, street halal food after the 80 mile ride.<br />Rice.<br />Chicken.<br />Lamb.<br />Fluffy pita.<br />White sauce and a pinch of the red.<br />And all in a pie tin. We knew about it before it was cool. ;)</p>

                <h3>Nightmares of the Sun</h3>
                <p class="description">One of the main reasons for the trip - my favorite band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opeth">Opeth</a> was playing at Radio City Music Hall. They played a ton of songs, including a few from their new album Sorceress and a bunch from two of their most acclaimed albums "Deliverance" and "Damnation." It was a fantastic show and Radio City is only a few blocks from my friend's apartment.</p>
                <p class="description">Here's their new single: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqijfqecvA">Sorceress</a></p>

                <h3>Exploring on my own</h3>
                <p class="description">I was done riding so I spent the final day exploring. I went to a few museums, had some coffee, and bought some souvenirs. Here's the Flatiron Building:</p>

                <h3>Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-aayyyy</h3>
                <p class="description">I had to make a stop at the Comedy Cellar. So many of my favorite comedians have played here. I wasn't able to see a show though.</p>

                <h3>Good things happen in bars</h3>
                <p class="description">I stepped into a bar for a quick beer and made friends with a guy that had an extra ticket for the last Yankees game of the season! That was a wild time and I was able to meet my friends again later that evening for sushi and then some music.</p>
